## 🔑 User Onboarding

Because this is a closed institutional platform, public registration is disabled. 

Once logged in as an **Admin**, you can easily onboard students and faculty using the **Bulk Add (CSV)** feature in the Admin dashboard. All bulk-created users are assigned the default password: `CampusLearn@123`, which they can use to log in initially.
